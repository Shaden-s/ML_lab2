# Problem description
The Customer Churn Dataset is used in this project and includes demographic and behavioral details of customers, including account balance, activity status, age, and geography.

The machine learning problem is to estimate whether a customer is going to drop the service or continue to use it depending on the provided features. It is a problem of classification since the output is two possible states.

The Exited variable is the target variable in this dataset and it shows whether a customer has churned or not. The model will be expected to learn customer data patterns to differentiate between potential customer churners and potential customer stayers.
